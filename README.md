The files contains the simple object detection library and the code created for the ESP32-CAM module

## Features

- The Libraray supports ESP32 based microcontrollers.
- The libray was developed using Edge Impulse
- The dataset was trained for three main objects. (glue bottle, watch, power bank)
- The results of the training came with a  F1 score of 89.7%
- It shows an 91.53% accuracy during testing
